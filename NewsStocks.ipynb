    "This workshop predicts movement in the Dow Jones Industrial Average by examining the top 25 news headlines of the day from the [Reddit World News subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/?hl=). Natural language processing is used to tokenize the news headlines of a given day, build a vocabulary, and count the occurences of each token in the vocabulary. A binary classification is used to predict if the Dow Jones Industrial Average adjusted close value increased or decreased in a given day."
